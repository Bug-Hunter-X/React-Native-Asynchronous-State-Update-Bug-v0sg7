The solution lies in using the functional update form of `setState` and accessing the state variable only after it has been updated.  Additionally, using the useEffect hook appropriately can address timing issues. 

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = async () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Updated count:', count); // Log after update
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

In this corrected version, the `useEffect` hook ensures that `console.log` is only called *after* `count` has been updated. The functional update syntax, `setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)`,  is used to update the state based on the previous state. This is crucial for handling updates correctly in asynchronous actions.
