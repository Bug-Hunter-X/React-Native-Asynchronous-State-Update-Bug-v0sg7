This error occurs when you try to access a property of a state variable before it has been fully updated. This is common when using asynchronous operations, such as API calls, within the setState function.  The problem is that setState is asynchronous, meaning the state variable doesn't update instantly.  Therefore, accessing the state variable immediately after calling setState might result in accessing the old value.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const incrementCount = async () => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  console.log(count); // count is still 0
};
```

This will log 0, not 1, because the `console.log` happens before `setState` completes.

This problem frequently appears with React Native's `useEffect` hook and asynchronous actions within the effect.
